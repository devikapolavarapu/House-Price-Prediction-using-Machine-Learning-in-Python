## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing 2,919 property records with the following key features:
- MSSubClass: Building class
- MSZoning: General zoning classification
- LotArea: Lot size in square feet
- LotConfig: Lot configuration
- BldgType: Type of dwelling
- OverallCond: Overall condition rating (1-10)
- YearBuilt: Original construction year
- YearRemodAdd: Remodel date
- Exterior1st: Exterior covering
- BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished basement area (sq ft)
- TotalBsmtSF: Total basement area (sq ft)
- SalePrice: Target variable (to be predicted)
